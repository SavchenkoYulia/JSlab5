# Content Management System with Type-Safe Architecture

## Objective
Design a type-safe Content Management System (CMS) using TypeScript. The system should include:

1. **Content Structure**: Create a base interface for content, extending it for different content types such as Articles and Products.
2. **Content Operations**: Implement generic types for operations like create, read, update, and delete for different content types.
3. **Access Control**: Design a role-based access control system for managing user permissions (admin, editor, viewer).
4. **Validation System**: Create a validation system for different content types, supporting basic and composite validators.
5. **Versioning**: Implement versioning for content to track changes over time.
